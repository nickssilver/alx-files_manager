# File Manager


A file manager in `backend development` is a software component or tool that facilitates the management and manipulation of files and directories within a server or a 
computer system. It provides a user interface or an `API` (Application Programming Interface) for users or other software components to interact with the file system and 
perform various operations such as creating, deleting, moving, renaming, and accessing files and directories.

In backend development, a file manager plays a crucial role in handling file-related tasks and is commonly used in web applications, content management systems (CMS), 
and other systems that involve file storage and retrieval. It enables developers to implement file uploading, downloading, organizing, and searching functionalities 
within their applications.
